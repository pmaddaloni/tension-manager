		The dark clouds overhead begin to open up, and their contents begin to spill out. As the rain begins to come out your cigarette sputters out. You throw it to the ground and flip your coat collar up. The man's madness seems invigorated by the downpour, and his grin spreads from ear to ear. You swear you can see the bomb ever so slightly better now, though you know that makes no sense. Perhaps you should just join him up there, you muse.

		Dusk has its tendency on dark and overcast days to obscure little details around us. The man hardly seems to notice the pigeons that are perched on the window sill above him. As he begins to shout something derisive at you, he startles the pigeons into a frenzy of feathers and cooing as they scatter in a flurry. This unexpected event takes the man by surprise, and as the pigeons fly into his face while attempting to escape, he stumbles around the ledge.

		The man begins muttering to himself. First slowly, then talking faster while fingering the aparatus strapped to his chest. He begins pointing at what, you can only guess, and then shrieks. He gesticulates wildly, then stumbles a bit. Leaping to his feet he screams again down at the crowd, something indiscernible. You nervously grasp your pack in your pocket, unsure of what he will do.
