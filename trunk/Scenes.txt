<Intro>

  As you arrive on the scene, the uneasy murmur of the crowd dies down for a moment as people notice you. The lights of the squad cars around you silently spin around their bases and officers talk quietly amongst each other. You gaze moves up the building’s many stories to come to a stop on the crazed man standing near the edge of the building. The officers have begun trying to clear out the crowd, but this is not going as well or quickly as hoped. You sigh and wonder what could’ve driven this man to this. You go over the facts in your head. The man has a bomb strapped to himself apparently set to go off after 5 minutes. He’s threatening to jump from the building, which you’re not sure would detonate the bomb. If he stays on the ledge too long, he ostensibly will blow up part of the building which would cause dangerous debris and rubble to hurtle down to the crowd below. Clouds are quickly moving in overhead, which does not bode well for the situation. He’s screaming something at you.

“Oh good, another one! The more the merrier motherfuckers! Save your breath you waste of space. I’m going to end this and you’re welcome to come with me if you’d like!”
